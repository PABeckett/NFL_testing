## Data Acquisition
- Source: course‑provided CSVs (player‑level weekly stats).


## Data Cleaning & Structures
- Columns used for metrics: `passing_yards`, `passing_tds`, `rushing_yards`, `rushing_tds`, `receiving_yards`, `receiving_tds`, `targets`, `receptions`.

- Home: AFC/NFC + division pills; metric/season/position filters; ranked table — per your sketch.
